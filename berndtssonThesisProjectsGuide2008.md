Let us consider the aim and objectives of the first example project in Sect. 5.2.2.  
  
The aim of this project was to “extend an already existing theory or model”.  
  
We assume that you have already collected, read and presented the relevant data (i.e. the existing theory or model).  
  
  
- According to the first objective, you should “identify the details of the extension”. In order to fulfil this objective you need to analyse the collected data (e.g. details of possible extensions). In this example, you would identify which features should be included in the extension. You will then need to justify why some features are more relevant than others. The result of this objective is your detailed description of the extension.  
  
- In the second objective, you should “introduce the extension to the original theoretical model”. In order to fulfil this objective you need to first introduce the extension to the original model. It further implies that you need to verify that the extension is correctly introduced. The result of this objective is a new theoretical model composed of the original theoretical model and the extension.  
  
- In the third objective, you should “compare the original theoretical model with the extended version”. In order to fulfil this objective you need to compare the two models against some comparison criteria. The result of this objective may be to ascertain whether the new model has better support for some features than the old model.
