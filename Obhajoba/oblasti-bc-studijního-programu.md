## Q&A
### a) Rozdíl mezi Governance a Management 
**Governance defines what needs to be done, while management focuses on how it should be done.** Governance involves understanding an organization's needs, setting direction through prioritization and decision-making, and monitoring compliance with objectives. Management, on the other hand, is the process of developing and executing plans in alignment with established goals. 

Governance is about establishing rules and a control framework, including a system for measurement and oversight. Its objective is to create well-defined rules to effectively achieve goals. In the context of IT, this translates to rules specifically for IT operations. 

Management takes the objectives set by stakeholders and puts them into practice. This can be visualized as a cycle of Planning, Building, Running, and Monitoring.

### b) Klíčové oblasti Enterprise Governance of IT 
**Key Areas of EGIT**

The key areas of Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) are depicted in Figure 3 below: 
These areas are influenced by **Stakeholder Value Drivers**. 

  IT Resource Management
*   IT Strategic Alignment
*   IT Value Delivery
*   Risk Management
*   Performance Measurement

#### **EGIT Framework**
The EGIT framework (e.g., COBIT 5) encompasses all necessary processes and IT resources, ensuring that IT effectively supports the company in generating value and meeting stakeholder expectations.

Stakeholders anticipate several key benefits from implementing EGIT:

*   Increased transparency between shareholders, executives, and IT management, including the cascading of objectives.
*   Compliance with all relevant laws, regulations, and policies.
*   Establishment of control mechanisms and reporting procedures.
*   Enhanced value creation from IT and allocated resources.
*   Timely risk identification and mitigation related to IT.
*   Improved IT management aligned with best practices.



EGIT is an integral part of overall enterprise governance and is overseen by the board of directors. It involves defining and implementing processes, structures, and mechanisms that enable business and IT personnel to fulfill their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment. This alignment is crucial for creating business value from IT-enabled business investments.

### c) Základní principy COBIT 5 
**Five Principles of COBIT 5**

COBIT 5 is a widely accepted framework for implementing and operating IT Governance. The five principles of COBIT 5 are: 

*   Meeting the needs of various stakeholders
*   Complete coverage of the entire enterprise
*   Use of a single integrated framework
*   Enabling a holistic approach
*   Distinguishing governance from management

Governance defines what needs to be achieved, while management focuses on how to achieve it. One benefit of COBIT is that it lists best practices, allowing organizations to select those most relevant to their specific requirements. 
#### COBIT5
**COBIT5: A Comprehensive Framework for Enterprise Governance of IT**

COBIT5 is a widely recognized framework for implementing and managing IT governance.  It provides a set of documents outlining best practices for IT management, offering a more structured approach than ITIL.  COBIT5 serves as a valuable tool for various stakeholders including business process owners, IT managers, IT professionals, and auditors across all organization types.  A key advantage of COBIT5 is its flexibility: organizations can select and implement the best practices most relevant to their specific needs.

**Five Principles of COBIT5**

COBIT5 is built upon five key principles designed to ensure comprehensive IT governance: 

*   **Meeting Stakeholder Needs:** This principle highlights that IT's primary purpose is to serve the broader needs of the entire organization.  Without this fundamental understanding, effective information governance is unattainable. 
*   **Covering the Enterprise End-to-End:** COBIT5 recognizes that information and IT usage extend beyond the IT department and are integral to the entire enterprise.  Therefore, managing information effectively is everyone's responsibility. 
*   **Applying a Single Integrated Framework:** COBIT5 is designed to align with other frameworks and methodologies, such as ITIL and ISO27001, at a high level, making it an effective overarching framework for governing and managing all information.
*   **Enabling a Holistic Approach:**  COBIT5 advocates for a comprehensive view of governance, recognizing that managing information across a broad spectrum of resources or "enablers" is more beneficial than a siloed approach. 
*   **Separating Governance From Management:** COBIT5 distinguishes between governance and management, emphasizing that they are distinct concepts. Governance involves comprehending organizational needs, establishing direction through prioritization and decision-making, and monitoring compliance with objectives. Conversely, management is the mechanism for developing and executing plans in accordance with agreed-upon goals.  In essence, governance dictates *what* needs to be accomplished, while management focuses on *how* to achieve it.

While the provided information does not offer a detailed definition of COBIT5, it highlights its significance as a framework for IT governance that is more structured than ITIL.  

The sources also mention the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), a strategic management tool often used in conjunction with IT governance frameworks like COBIT5, which links strategy to operational activities with a focus on performance measurement.

### d) Na co reaguje ITIL 4 a jaké jsou rozdíly vůči ITIL 3
 ITIL 4: Response to Changing IT Landscape and Differences from ITIL 3

**ITIL 4 reacts to the changing IT world, which is characterized by increasing complexity and new trends.**  It reflects external factors such as customer and supplier participation. The new trends include software dominance, Agile, Lean & DevOps approaches, and a focus on benefits over technology. 

**One of the main differences from ITIL 3 is that ITIL 4 focuses on the benefits of aligning IT with business strategy.** ITIL 4 emphasizes adaptability to changes in business and technology. **It incorporates Agile, DevOps, and Lean concepts with traditional ITIL best practices to create a more adaptable ITSM framework.**

ITIL 3, on the other hand, centers on the ITIL Service Lifecycle. The five book volumes cover best practices in the following five phases of the service lifecycle: Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition, Service Operation, and Continual Service Improvement. The query regarding the specific practices in ITIL 4 in relation to ITIL 3 processes was addressed in a previous response: "Practices replace ITIL 3 processes." 
#### ITIL3
**ITIL3: A Comprehensive Definition**

ITIL, or Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a collection of concepts and procedures that enable better planning, utilization, and improvement of IT for both IT service providers and customers. ITIL distinguishes between three levels of processes: 
- strategic, 
- tactical, and 
- operational. 
The strategic level manages the quality and security of IT services and organizes their management. The tactical level, which involves planning and controlling IT services, focuses on fulfilling customer needs. Finally, the operational level supports IT services to ensure their efficient delivery by the service organization.

One of the key concepts in ITIL v3 is the **ITIL Service Lifecycle**, a five-phase, service-focused approach to IT service management. These phases are:

*   **Service Strategy:**  This phase involves understanding customer needs and aligning IT services with business objectives.
*   **Service Design:** This phase focuses on designing and developing IT services to meet the defined needs.
*   **Service Transition:**  This phase covers the processes for building and deploying IT services into the live environment.
*   **Service Operation:** This phase includes processes for managing and supporting IT services in operation.
*   **Continual Service Improvement (CSI):** This phase aims to continually improve the quality and efficiency of IT services. 
#### ITIL4 
**ITIL4: An Adaptable Framework for Evolving IT Landscapes**

ITIL4 represents a significant shift from ITIL v3 in its approach to IT Service Management. While ITIL4 is a comprehensive framework, its core principles center around IT service management for customers, processes and practices, products and services, and aligning IT with business strategy.  ITIL4 acknowledges the evolving technological landscape and incorporates concepts from Agile, DevOps, and Lean methodologies alongside traditional ITIL best practices.  This integration results in a more adaptable ITSM framework equipped to evolve alongside the industry.

One of the defining characteristics of ITIL4 is its emphasis on adaptability to changes in business and technology. ITIL4 prioritizes a practical approach to managing the fundamental principles of high-quality service, implementing ITIL in organizations of all sizes, and ensuring its compatibility with frameworks such as Agile, Lean, and DevOps.

Instead of processes, ITIL4 introduces the concept of **"practices."**  These practices encompass organizational resources designed to perform work or accomplish an objective.  Examples include incident management, change enablement, and deployment management.  

The guiding **principles** within ITIL4 emphasize value creation, starting from the current state, iterative progress based on feedback, collaborative efforts with enhanced visibility, holistic thinking, and optimization through automation.

### a) Klíčové aplikace - ERP, CRM, BI, SCM, MES 
#### ERP 
##### definition - prezentace
**ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** integrates key business processes, functions, and data across an organization. It uses software applications to manage and coordinate a company's resources and activities. ERP systems aim to improve the process of fulfilling customer orders, automating steps from order placement to invoicing and revenue generation.

**Data Types Used in ERP:**

* **Parameters** 
* **Numeric data**
* **Master data:** Includes management processes for master data and their temporal validity.
* **Customer data**
* **Archived data:** Retention often driven by legislation.

**Data Processing in ERP:**

* **Transactional data:** Used for day-to-day operations. 
* **Analytical data:** Used for business intelligence (BI) to gain insights into business performance.
* **Analytical tasks based on big data and AI:**  Leverage advanced analytics for decision-making.

**Key ERP Activities:**

* **Data Management:**  Manages core data such as bills of materials, workflows, supplier and customer information, warehouse locations, workplaces, tax types, exchange rates, and accounts.
* **Resource Planning:**  Performs long-term, mid-term, and short-term resource planning to fulfill sales orders.
* **Sales Order Execution:** Manages the execution of sales orders to ensure timely delivery.
* **Cost Planning and Tracking:** Plans and tracks implementation costs, particularly important in manufacturing.
* **Financial Integration:** Integrates results from all activities into financial accounting and controlling processes.

**Note:** The provided text does not offer a specific definition for ERP II but mentions it in the context of expanding ERP system modules.

##### ERP Definition - výpisky
**ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** systems are software applications that manage and coordinate a company's resources and activities. They automate and integrate key business processes, functions, and data across an organization.  

**ERP systems offer a unified view of operations across different departments, providing:**

*   Planning capabilities. 
*   Inventory management.
*   Purchasing functionality.
*   Sales and marketing tools.
*   Finance and human resources management.

Think of it like this: each department typically needs its own software to function. With ERP, each department still gets its own software, but it can now communicate and share information with all other departments in the organization.  This allows a salesperson to have all the necessary information to complete an order. It also allows different departments to see the same data about an order and update it in real-time.

**Key ERP activities include:**

*   Managing core data (e.g., bills of materials, workflows, suppliers, customers, warehouse locations, workplaces, tax types, exchange rates, accounts).
*   Long-term, mid-term, and short-term resource planning for fulfilling sales orders.
*   Managing the execution of sales orders to meet deadlines.
*   Planning and tracking implementation costs, especially in manufacturing.
*   Integrating results from all activities into financial accounting and controlling.

ERP systems are designed to improve the process of fulfilling customer orders, from order placement to invoicing and revenue generation. For instance, when a sales employee enters an order into the system, the ERP system incorporates it into company plans and automates the steps for completion. 

**However, the success of an ERP system relies on timely and accurate data entry by users.**

**ERP solutions are categorized based on:**

*  **Customer size:** large, medium, and small companies. 
*  **Level of integration support:** This categorization was not defined in the provided text.

The provided text does not include a definition for ERP II, but it does mention ERP II and extended ERP when discussing expanding modules in ERP systems.

* **Better inventory management** 
* **Streamlined financial processes**
* **Improved customer relationship management**
* **Reduced operational costs**

**Challenges of Implementing ERP:**

* **Complexity:** Implementing ERP systems can be a challenging process that requires significant time, resources, and expertise.
* **Cost:**  ERP implementation can be expensive, especially for large organizations or complex projects.
* **Change Management:**  Implementing ERP often requires changes to business processes, which can be met with resistance from employees.
* **Training:** Proper training for all users is essential for successful ERP adoption.

**Note:** While the text does not provide a specific definition for ERP II (extended ERP), it mentions that complex and robust ERP solutions often integrate additional modules to process data that may not be strictly transactional. Examples of these integrated applications include ECM, BI, CRM, SCM, PLM, PDM, and ERM.  You may want to consult additional resources for a detailed explanation of ERP II and its functionalities. 

#### CRM
##### definition 1
 Definition and Characteristics of CRM

**CRM (Customer Relationship Management)** is a complex of information technology applications, technical resources, business processes, and human resources designed to manage and improve relationships with customers.  CRM focuses on supporting business activities, especially sales, marketing, and customer services. CRM is based on an active, centralized database that supports process automation, similar to ERP. The goal of CRM is to improve communication with the customer, especially its coordination within the company. CRM allows customers to actively communicate with multiple suppliers of the desired product, customize their requirements, and compare the most suitable offer in terms of price, delivery date, and method.  Important trends in CRM include: 

* Development of data collection about the client, order, service provided, its monitoring, and tracing. 
* Development of the Internet of Things.
* Development of social networks and artificial intelligence.

###### Functional Areas of CRM Applications 

There are four basic ways in which CRM is applied, which can also be deployed independently in a company: active CRM, operational CRM, collaborative CRM, and analytical CRM.

**Operational CRM** focuses on supporting the daily agenda associated with finding and acquiring customers and retaining them in the long term. Operational CRM supports "front office" business processes and includes sales, marketing, and services. Every interaction with the customer is added to their contact history, and every employee can draw appropriate information from this database if needed. The functions of this part focus on:

*   **Sales Force Automation (SFA)** supports the agenda of sales representatives, where CRM applications typically include contact management, opportunity management, lead management, including comprehensive order cycle management. 

*   **Customer Service and Support (CSS)** focuses on providing detailed information about the company's products and covers complaint management and the organization of warranty and post-warranty service. They are often represented by self-service applications that allow customers to obtain all the necessary information about the product, or even applications for managing communities in which customers support each other.

**Collaborative CRM** focuses on the controlled operation of all possible communication channels that the company has built, not only with its loyal customers but also with potential customers. It expands the previously used ways of contacting customers, such as mail, faxes, telephone contacts, and personal meetings (1:1), to include the Internet and mobile communications.  Collaborative CRM involves direct interaction with the customer and includes various communication channels, such as the internet and Interactive Voice Response (IVR). The goal of collaborative CRM can be broad and can include reducing costs and improving the services provided. This communication does not involve sales representatives ("self-service"). All of this is usually coordinated and managed using contact centers (or call centers), which are applications and technologies within CRM based on a central customer approach to the company. Contact centers store and regularly update information about any contact with customers, including handling complaints, information about the handover and type of offer, sending marketing materials, information about the signing of a contract, and more. 

**Analytical CRM** focuses on processing customer knowledge. It analyzes customer data from different perspectives for tasks such as:

* Designing and implementing targeted marketing campaigns that lead to their higher effectiveness. 
* Designing and implementing targeted marketing campaigns involving cross-selling or up-selling.
* Analysis of customer behavior to support decisions about products and services (e.g., determining appropriate prices, developing new products, etc.).
* Management decisions such as financial forecasting and customer profitability analysis.

The analytical part of CRM is usually implemented by using customer data obtained from operational and collaborative CRM, or other applications (ERP, e-business), and using business intelligence technologies and applications to process the analysis. Such a combination of CRM and BI is referred to as customer intelligence and is mostly understood as a synonym for analytical CRM. Customer intelligence (CI) thus represents functionality focused on customer knowledge, their value, preferences, riskiness, or the probability of leaving for the competition. CI primarily focuses on the collection and analysis of data from interactions with the customer and uses processes and sources such as records of business contacts, contact center documentation, data from e-commerce applications, corporate portals, and capturing the so-called click stream, i.e. accesses and procedures for using the functions of web applications by the customer. The analytical capabilities of CI also enabled business analysts to focus on customer value and, based on this value, influence the quality of support for individual customer segments. The concept of customer value (CV) consists of quantifying its past and future benefits and costs and therefore works with indicators such as customer profitability (calculated as the difference between customer revenues and the sum of direct and indirect costs for the past period), the risk of customer churn, and others.

CRM applications bring these specific possibilities:

*  Salespeople obtain and share **detailed information about customers**, their requirements and needs, information about business opportunities, and the status and progress of individual business cases. Based on this information, they are able to apply an individual approach to individual customers.
*  Customers have at their disposal **higher quality information services**  about their orders and can use effective communication with the company regardless of the communication channel used.
*  Thanks to the management of business opportunities, automated processing of business opportunities, sales process management, and competitor monitoring, **increased sales success** is achieved.
*  Comprehensive information about potential and realized business activities creates a basis for **sales performance analyzes** and thus for its increase, enables the creation of sales forecasts, monitoring of business activities and their effectiveness, etc.

#### BI
##### def
 Business Intelligence (BI): Definition and characteristics

**BI applications** represent products for the improvement of quality and performance of company management and an increase in the competitiveness of a company. **BI** supports management in real time and integrates physically or locally independent information sources. **BI applications** are intended for top and middle management, as well as for analysts, planners, and specialists. This means that, unlike with transaction systems, their users are not users of company processes within the basic functional modules.

**BI** applications are applications with multidimensionally available information. **BI** uses OLAP databases, which support the principle of multidimensionality - they contain one or more OLAP cubes, in which data are stored by dimension and thus allow for more flexible changes to criteria for analysis and data aggregation.

When implemented, **BI** software products provide their users with:

*   **up-to-date information**: For example, about the status of suppliers, customers, sales, warehouses, and work in progress, without waiting for processing of the respective periodic closures in transaction systems
*   **independence:** This is because they remove the need to determine information through more levels of management, where unwanted "noise" can occur and where processing can be unnecessarily lengthy and it might be possible to draw from more data sources at the same time
*   **flexibility:** When querying information that cannot be specified beforehand or for which doing so would be ineffective

The basic options for implementing software support for decision-making can be found in these areas:

*   **reporting:** This includes the provision of necessary reports with specified values, along with their analyses and trends
*   **analyses**: That is, the option of processing more detailed and specific multidimensional data analyses, including the performance of ad hoc queries
*   **query**: These represent ad hoc query tools, including the option of predefining different queries

Outputs from **BI applications** may be available in printed or electronic form in the office or on a laptop, during meetings with business partners or with one's own colleagues, and, by means of mobile devices, they are available from anywhere at any time.

The quality of individual applications of company IS is closely linked with the quality of the data used; this is doubly true in the case of **BI**. This may not always be ensured, because data is entered manually by many users with varying degrees of "literacy"; furthermore, data originates from different applications and sources, which may cause varying interpretations of such. Errors also arise as a result of conversions or, as the case may be, unauthorized interventions or inappropriate tests. **BI** applications are often becoming a component of the offerings of standard suppliers of applications in the ERP category, and the trends of these platforms from 2011 within the Magic Quadrant confirm their significant potential.

The most common tool for the creation of **BI applications** over OLAP cubes are Excel pivot tables and charts. Alongside other standard program tools (SQL, VBA), some special tools are used for the implementation of **BI applications**, such as tools for creating OLAP cubes, data mining tools, etc.

Outputs, or reports, from data warehouses and marketplaces should be placed on company portals not only for use by internal company workers, but also, in certain management areas, for company business partners (order statuses, etc.). The offering of this functionality with an understanding and respect for the needs of even external subjects is one of the essential effects of **BI** and thus also influences its ultimate success.

#### SCM
##### definition 1
SCM Definition and Characteristics

**SCM (Supply Chain Management)** is defined as the management of the supply chain. It is a set of tools and processes used to optimize the management and maximize the efficiency of supply chain operations (supplier - manufacturer - distributor - seller - customer) with regard to the end customer. Through interconnection, partners in the chain can cooperate, share information, plan, and coordinate the entire process to increase the responsiveness of the chain. SCM is often just one module of a complex ERP system. 

A **supply chain** consists of the following entities: supplier - manufacturer - distributor - seller - customer.

###### Specific Capabilities of SCM Applications

*   Provide a planning platform that allows companies to create, manage, and share plans so that the overall supply chain plan is aligned with the interests and plans of its individual links (purchasing, production, transport, warehousing plans).
*   Determine the delivery date for the customer based on:
    *   Available stock of finished products (ATP - Available to Promise method).
    *   Available stock and customer location (AATP - Allocated Available to Promise method).
    *   Availability of material and capacities if the product is not available (CTP - Capable to Promise method).
*   Evaluate the efficiency of the chain.
*   Communicate between the individual links of the chain and process messages.

###### SCM / APS Application Functions

*   **Supply Chain Design:** Dividing individual roles in the supply chain (e.g., chain organizer, preferred supplier) and determining the basic material flows between its members.
*   **Information Flow Management:** Managing the flow of information between participants (executing transactions, verification, order processing, billing, etc.).
*   **Planning:**
    *   Short-term sales planning: Determining the delivery date of products for a specific customer order based on existing information about available inventory while optimizing the fulfillment of the requirement in terms of costs, price, logistics, etc.
    *   Medium-term planning for the entire supply chain of procurement, production, and distribution: Cooperation of partners in planning deliveries, planning transport, purchasing, deliveries of raw materials and semi-finished products, planning, and production management. 
*   **Decision Support:** Collecting data and converting it into a more understandable form (graphs) and forecasting sales with the required minimum inventory level of finished products for each plant or distribution center.

###### The SCOR Model 

The **SCOR Model** is a cross-industry standard diagnostic tool for strategy, performance management, and process improvement for supply chain management developed and approved by the Supply Chain Council.  The model explicitly defines processes, subprocesses, and activities, i.e., Levels 1 to 3, so that they are applicable in any sector of the economy. 

The specification at Levels 4 and 5 is left to the competence of the supply chain itself or sector-oriented interest associations, as it is assumed that a specific activity can be implemented differently in different sectors.

The SCOR Model elaborates on processes at five levels:

1.  Defines five key supply chain processes: planning, purchasing, production, shipping, and returns.
2.  Specifies subprocesses for Level 1 processes, depending on the strategies chosen. These can either relate to all processes or to a specific process. Examples include the application of the Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) method or the Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) method. For example, the "make-to-stock" or "make-to-order" strategy applies only to the **production** process. An example of a subprocess for the "make-to-order" strategy is "product assembly." 
3.  Defines individual activities for Level 2 subprocesses. For example, for the "product assembly" subprocess, this is the activity of creating a bill of materials (BOM) for the product.
4.  Specifies workflows, inputs, outputs, and operations for individual activities.
5.  Characterizes the possibilities of automation using IT for individual workflows.

###### Conditions for Quality Supply Chain Collaboration

*   Long-term and mutually beneficial relationship.
*   Reliability of production.
*   Quality of goods and favorable prices.
*   Payment reliability.
*   Ensuring a minimum level of inventory while maintaining the stability, depth, and breadth of the assortment.
*   Ensuring proper packaging of goods.
*   Appropriate use of IS/ICT by all participating entities.

The source does not provide information about the role of the SCOR Model in designing IT support for supply chain management or the state of the market in the area of ICT products that focus on supporting supply chain management. It does, however, mention that efforts to implement software applications to support supply chains were limited before the internet, and that the advantages of the internet have opened up new possibilities for supply chains such as the rapid development of B2B e-commerce.

#### MES
##### definition 1
 Definition and Characteristics of MES 

**MES (Manufacturing Execution System)** systems are a type of software that connects and provides a link between business planning systems, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), and the actual physical production processes within a manufacturing plant.  MES systems collect real-time data from the production floor and use it to monitor and control the manufacturing process. Unlike ERP systems, which are more universal in nature, MES systems are more specialized and tailored to specific types of manufacturing.  

**Core Functionalities of MES Systems:**

*   **Resource and Capacity Management:** Allocating resources, including machines, tools, and labor, to specific production tasks.
*   **Production Process Management:** Managing and tracking production steps, including data exchange with other systems for bills of materials, production rules, and resource allocation.
*   **Detailed Production Planning:** Creating detailed production schedules that optimize efficiency by minimizing setup times, energy consumption, and downtime.
*   **Dispatching:** Assigning and managing work orders to specific equipment and operators on the production floor.
*   **Production Control:**  Monitoring and managing the execution of planned production orders, ensuring that resources are used efficiently, and providing real-time status updates to ERP systems.
*   **Data Collection:** Capturing and storing real-time data from the production process, including machine status, material consumption, and production progress.
*   **Product Tracking and Genealogy:** Tracking the complete production history of each product, including the materials, equipment, and operators involved, which is essential for quality control, audits, and regulatory compliance.
*   **Performance Analysis:**  Analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) to track production efficiency, quality, and other critical metrics, enabling continuous improvement efforts.

The information provided in the given source does not elaborate on the relationship between MES and WMS.

### c) Přínosy, rizika a trendy podnikových IS
  Benefits, Risks, and Trends in Enterprise IS

#### Benefits of Enterprise IS
* **Reduced Inventory:** Effective use of Material Requirements Planning (MRP) can lead to a reduction in inventory levels, freeing up financial resources that would otherwise be tied up in stock. 

* **Improved Planning:**  Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems, often used in conjunction with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, can enhance decision-making by providing better data. This leads to more reliable delivery plans and a feasible master production schedule.

* **Meeting Customer Needs:** MRP prioritizes customer needs and production plan requirements over simply determining what can be produced based on available materials and capacity.

* **Meeting Future Demands:**  MRP focuses on anticipated needs rather than relying on static historical sales data, making it a forward-looking planning tool.

#### Risks of Enterprise IS

* **Implementation Challenges:** APS systems can be complex to implement and manage, often requiring reliance on external consultants. Additionally, companies may face the challenge of working with parallel systems during implementation.

* **Dependence on Suppliers:** Implementing an off-the-shelf software solution, while cost-effective and efficient, creates a dependence on the supplier for ongoing support and development. 

* **Inaccurate Data:** The effectiveness of Enterprise IS, especially Business Intelligence (BI) applications, relies heavily on the quality of data used. Inaccurate or inconsistent data entry can negatively impact the reliability of these systems.

#### Trends in Enterprise IS
* **Focus on Smaller Businesses:**  Initially prevalent in large enterprises, Enterprise IS solutions are increasingly being tailored for small and medium-sized businesses.

* **Faster Implementation:**  There's a growing trend towards reducing the implementation time for Enterprise IS.

* **Industry-Specific Solutions:** Enterprise IS are now developed as solutions for specific groups of existing customers rather than for individual businesses.

* **Integration with External Data:** Enterprise IS are expanding to incorporate data from sources external to the company, providing a more comprehensive view of the business environment.

* **New Technologies**: Modern Enterprise IS leverage technologies like cloud computing, open source software, mobile devices, and social networks.

* **Importance of Services:**  There's a greater emphasis on providing comprehensive services alongside Enterprise IS products, ensuring successful implementation and ongoing support.

* **Increased Maintenance Costs:**  Despite the benefits, the cost of maintaining Enterprise IS is on the rise.

* **Mergers and Acquisitions:**  The market is witnessing a wave of mergers and acquisitions, with larger companies acquiring smaller players to expand their product portfolios and market share.

* **Reduced Employee Resistance:** Employee resistance to the implementation of new systems and processes is diminishing.

### **Relationship between IT and Business**

Business processes are designed to achieve business goals.  A business goal is what a company wants to achieve based on its global strategy. Business goals should be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound). An information service focuses on supporting one or more business processes. An information source is a necessary part of creating and operating an information service. **SPSPR** is a model that uses ICT services as the basic tool for communication between business and the ICT department. The model defines the responsibilities of business and ICT managers in managing the business-IT relationship. The model is based on managing the business-IT relationship in five interconnected layers (S-Strategy, P-Business Processes, S-ICT Services, P-ICT Processes, R-ICT Resources).  ICT services are understood in the model as an interface between business and IT, through which the ICT service provider supports individual business processes of the company or their partial activities. An ICT service can either be purchased on the ICT market or delivered internally. In the second case, the company's ICT department must ensure ICT processes that will deliver the service, and ICT resources (HW, SW, data, people, etc.) that are necessary for the course of ICT processes.

The **MMDIS** methodology has been developed at the Department of Information Technologies at the University of Economics in Prague since the early 1990s. The methodology aims to contribute to the education of ICT specialists who will increase the success rate of ICT projects (i.e., it is intended for educational purposes). It includes both rigorous and agile approaches and thus helps future developers to experience individual methods and techniques. The methodology is open, methods and concepts evolve along with the development of the economic environment, information technologies, and management methods.

When solving IS/ICT, it is necessary to start from user views of IS/ICT and gradually transform them into solver views. User views on the functions of IS differ. It is necessary to include an analysis of the requirements (services) of these types of users. Solver views (IS/ICT dimensions) are used not only to implement user requirements for IS but also to verify these requirements in terms of reality and consistency.

The **MMDIS** methodology calls solver views dimensions of IS/ICT solutions. The dimensions are divided into two groups. The first group includes the time dimension of the solution, the level of abstraction in the IS/CIT solution, and the levels of IS/ICT integration. The second group then includes the content and methodological-organizational dimensions of IS/ICT development and operation. Each phase of IS/ICT development is characterized by its objectives, inputs, outputs, and solution process. The initial two phases of IS/ICT development are global and information strategies. These phases represent the strategic level of IS/ICT management.

In the course of IS/ICT solutions, several important characteristics of information are analyzed and designed.

Data is a string of characters of a certain alphabet. Information is represented by links between data, giving meaning to the data (reducing the entropy of the recipient). Information can be signal information (transmitted during processes), structural information (definition of processes, organizational structure), or genetic information (action schemes, value system, corporate culture [the way authority is asserted, the degree of formality, remuneration, methods of communication] - the stronger the genetic info, the weaker the structural info can be). Knowledge is the rules for deriving new information from information. Long-term competitiveness is not primarily in finance, technology, or data (all of which competitors can quickly copy) but in processes and corporate culture.

 Business Process Modeling Information

**Business Process Modeling Goals:**

* Simulate real processes in an organization.

**What is a Business Process?**

A **business process** is how a business achieves its business goals. It responds to important events and ensures the production of planned outputs, such as products or services.  A process is a group of connected tasks that together bring value to the customer. 

**Why Model Business Processes?**

There are several reasons to model business processes: 
* To model the current state of a process and the desired future state.
* To analyze the characteristics of the real-world process based on the model.
* To manage the real-world process based on the model.

**How to Represent Business Process Models:**

Models can be represented as diagrams. Often, diagram creation for system modeling is done using a set of rules, called a notation. When capturing an initial idea for a business, a simple sketch can be used without strict notation, giving the author more freedom in communication. However, for precise analysis, design, and subsequent automation, a model with a specific, strict notation is necessary. The specific notation will vary based on the use case.

**Key Factors for Successful Modeling:**

Several factors can cause modeling to fail. 

* **Communication:** Individual team members must be sufficiently familiar with the project and communicate with the client.
* **Consistency:** The team must use a consistent modeling technique (e.g., UML, BPMN) agreed upon in advance. They must also ensure consistency when using multiple model types so each one tells a cohesive story. Multiple types and views can lead to a greater understanding of the requirements of the IS/ICT system; therefore, inconsistencies in models can cause problems in future development.
* **Appropriate Expertise:** There must be good work organization; for example, assigning processes like invoicing to a specialist in financial processes. 
* **Scope:** There must be an effort to capture all aspects that are relevant to the system under investigation and eliminate irrelevant aspects.

**Business Process Management (BPMN)**

BPMN is an open standard for business process modeling. The current version is available at http://www.bpmn.org. BPMN is supported by most companies that develop tools for business process modeling. 

BPMN combines services, activities, data, processes, choreography, and conversations into a related system allowing for automation. A process is typically displayed (modeled) from left to right, beginning with a starting event, followed by a sequence of activities, and ending with an end state. The notation for modeling processes distinguishes between a variety of event types. 

**Process Modeling Levels**

One method distinguishes four levels of business process modeling and design. The levels differ mainly in the level of knowledge and experience expected from the people designing the process and from the people participating in its implementation. The creators of the process definition should choose the optimal level for each process.

* **Level 1:**  This level is used when the accumulated company knowledge is insufficient or when each process instance is very different due to changing conditions and external factors. Such a situation occurs mainly in strategic management processes. The first level assumes highly qualified and creative workers who will be able to plan and implement all previously undefined process characteristics. It includes the goals of the process (e.g., product/service and their characteristics); the event activating the given process; the expected outputs of the process, such as what is to be produced and its key characteristics; a list of all external inputs to the process (but inputs are not assigned to activities); and a list of suitable IT tools to support the process.
* **Level 4:** This level of process definition is typical for mass production, for example, the production of cars, the production of meals in McDonald's restaurants, etc.  The fourth level assumes a high level of qualification and extensive experience of the workers defining the process. In practice, the knowledge of consulting firms that know the best practices used in a given area of business is often used to define the process at this level. The fourth level simultaneously represents the highest degree of standardization of the course of the process. At the fourth level, the following are also defined: the inputs and outputs of each activity; instructions (algorithm) for each activity; the sequence of activities; the assignment of responsible roles to individual activities; the duration of each activity; and the costs of activities, respectively the costs of the entire process.

**SPSPR Model**

The SPSPR model uses ICT services as the basic tool for communication between business and the ICT department. The model defines the responsibilities of business and ICT managers in managing the business-IT relationship. The basis of the model is the management of the business-IT relationship in five interconnected layers (S - Strategy, P - Business Processes, S - ICT Services, P - ICT Processes, R - ICT Resources).

ICT services in the model are understood as an interface between business and IT, through which the ICT service provider supports individual business processes of the company or their partial activities. An ICT service can either be purchased on the ICT market or supplied internally. In the second case, the company's ICT department must ensure the ICT processes that will deliver the service and the ICT resources (hardware, software, data, people, etc.) that are necessary for the ICT processes to run.

**Relationship Between Business Goals, Processes, IT Services, Processes, and Resources**

Business goals, processes, IT services, IT processes, and IT resources are interconnected. Without this interconnection, an enterprise could not be managed effectively. Business processes are directed towards fulfilling business goals. IT services focus on supporting one or more business processes. An IT resource is a necessary component for the creation and operation of an IT service. 

A **business goal** is what a business wants to achieve based on its global strategy. Business goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound). An **IT service** is a set of IT functions provided to a user, which supports the performance of a particular activity.  An **IT process** is an activity or a set of activities performed by the IT department to provide the agreed quality of IT services. An **IT resource** is a set of tangible or intangible assets (e.g., hardware, software, data) used to provide an IT service.
