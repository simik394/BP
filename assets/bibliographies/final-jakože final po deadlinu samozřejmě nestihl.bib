  abstract = {This second edition guides the reader through successful planning and implementation of a thesis project and provides students in computer science and information systems with all the advice they need. The reader-friendly text offers a simple step-by-step guide to the key processes involved using an approach that has been tried and tested by the authors over a number of years. A new chapter on Information-seeking and use and a subsection entitled Improve your learning (and grade) have been added to strengthen the material on how to search for relevant literature and also how to validate it. In addition, this comprehensive and easy-to-follow text has been fine tuned and updated wherever appropriate. Features and topics: Developing your project proposal Developing the problem description Following objectives Presenting and analysing your data Drawing conclusions Presenting and defending your work Preparing the final version of your report As well as being an essential purchase for students in computer science and information systems, this clear and concise aid also contains lots of useful information for supervisors and examiners, including guidelines on how to review a thesis project. "...mandatory reading for all students embarking on their final year project. Easy to read, loaded with good advice and filled with to-the-point examples, it covers in a step-by-step fashion each and every aspect that readers might be looking for. Whether you have a bachelor, master or Ph.D thesis ahead of you, I strongly recommend you first study this excellent text." Prof. Dr. Klaus Dittrich, Department of Information Technology, University of Zurich, Switzerland " This book... presents a very clear exposition of basic research concepts that are often taken for granted and assumed to be part of common knowledge. It will be very useful reading for anyone undertaking research." Prof. Brian Fitzgerald, University of Limerick, Ireland.},

  abstract = {Several research efforts from different areas have focused on the execution of UML models, resulting in a diverse and complex scientific body of knowledge. With this work, we aim at identifying, classifying, and evaluating existing solutions for the execution of UML models. We conducted a systematic review in which we selected 63 research studies and 19 tools among over 5400 entries by applying a systematic search and selection process. We defined a classification framework for characterizing solutions for UML model execution, and we applied it to the 82 selected entries. Finally, we analyzed and discussed the obtained data. From the analyzed data, we drew the following conclusions: (i) There is a growing scientific interest on UML model execution; (ii) solutions providing translational execution clearly outnumber interpretive solutions; (iii) model-level debugging is supported in very few cases; (iv) only a few research studies provide evidence of industrial use, with very limited empirical evaluations; (v) the most common limitation deals with coverage of the UML language. Based on these observations, we discuss potential research challenges and implications for the future of UML model execution. Our results provide a concise overview of states of the art and practice for UML model execution intended for use by both researchers and practitioners.},
