## Highlights
- To understand it better, let's consider the topic of “Remote work and employee productivity.”Effective problem statement“Over the past decade, there has been a 70% increase in organizations adopting remote work policies. While some studies suggest remote work enhances employee productivity, others indicate potential declines due to distractions at home. However, there’s a lack of comprehensive research examining the specific factors in a remote environment that influence productivity. This study aims to identify and analyze these factors, providing organizations with actionable insights to optimize remote work policies.” — [Updated on 2023-10-25 03:36:50](https://hyp.is/5LCTrHLWEe6jmS9SnrHrfA/typeset.io/resources/statement-of-the-problem-in-research/) — Group: #bakalarka
    - Annotation: Why is this statement of a problem in research effective?
Specificity: The statement provides a clear percentage to highlight the rise in remote work.
Context: It acknowledges existing research and the conflicting findings.
Clear gap identification: It points out the lack of comprehensive research on specific factors affecting productivity in remote work.
Purpose: The statement concludes with a clear aim for the research.
- Ineffective problem statement"People are working from home a lot now, especially since there are so many internet tools. Some say it's good; others say it's not that great. This research will just look into the whole work-from-home thing and see what's up." — [Updated on 2023-10-25 03:37:11](https://hyp.is/_ECnAHLWEe6_rkviHUP8dg/typeset.io/resources/statement-of-the-problem-in-research/) — Group: #bakalarka
    - Annotation: Why is this statement of a problem in research ineffective?
Informal language: Phrases like "what's up" and "the whole work-from-home thing" are not suitable for academic writing.
Vagueness: The statement doesn't provide any specific data or context about the rise of remote work.
Lack of clear focus: It's unclear what aspect of remote work the research will address.
Ambiguous purpose: The statement doesn't specify the research's objectives or expected outcomes
- Here's a detailed guide to how you can write an effective statement of the problem in research. — [Updated on 2023-10-25 03:40:26](https://hyp.is/X-CwIHLXEe6ZdYMoszUlhw/typeset.io/resources/statement-of-the-problem-in-research/) — Group: #bakalarka
    - Annotation: Identify the research area: Before addressing a specific problem, you need to know the broader domain or field of your study. This helps in contextualizing your research and ensuring it aligns with existing academic disciplines.

Example: If you're curious about the effects of digital technology on human behavior, your broader research area might be Digital Sociology or Media Studies.

Conduct preliminary literature review: Familiarize yourself with existing research related to your topic. This will help you understand what's already known and, more importantly, identify gaps or unresolved questions in the existing knowledge. This step also ensures you're advancing upon existing work rather than replicating it.

Example: Upon reviewing literature on digital technology and behavior, you find many studies on social media's impact on youth but fewer on its effects on the elderly.

Read how to conduct an effective literature review.

Define the specific problem: After thoroughly reviewing the literature, pinpoint a particular issue that your research will address. Ensure that this chosen issue is not only of substantial importance in its field but also realistically approachable given your resources and expertise. To define it precisely, you might consider:

Highlighting discrepancies or contradictions in existing literature.
Emphasizing the real-world implications of this gap.
Assessing the feasibility of exploring this issue within your means and timeframe.
Example: You decide to investigate how digital technology, especially social media, affects the mental well-being of the elderly, given the limited research in this area.

Articulate clearly and concisely: Your problem statement should be straightforward and devoid of jargon. It needs to convey the essence of your research issue in a manner that's understandable to both experts and non-experts.

Example: "The impact of social media on the mental well-being of elderly individuals remains underexplored, despite the growing adoption of digital technology in this age group."

Highlight the significance: Explain why your chosen research problem matters. This could be due to its real-world implications, its potential to fill a knowledge gap or its relevance to current events or trends.

Example: As the elderly population grows and becomes more digitally connected, understanding the psychological effects of social media on this demographic could inform digital literacy programs and mental health interventions.

Ensure feasibility: Your research problem should be something you can realistically study, given your resources, timeframe, and expertise. It's essential to ensure that you can gather data, conduct experiments, or access necessary materials or participants.

Example: You plan to survey elderly individuals in local community centers about their social media usage and perceived mental well-being, ensuring you have the means to reach this demographic.

Seek feedback: Discuss your preliminary problem statement with peers, mentors, or experts in the field. They can provide insights, point out potential pitfalls, or suggest refinements.

Example: After discussing with a gerontologist, you decide to also consider the role of digital training in moderating the effects of social media on the elderly.

Refine and Revise: Based on feedback and further reflection, revise and improve your problem statement. This iterative process ensures clarity, relevance, and precision.

Example: Your refined statement reads: Despite the increasing digital connectivity of the elderly, the effects of social media on their mental well-being, especially in the context of digital training, remain underexplored.

By following these detailed steps, you can craft a research problem statement that is both compelling and academically rigorous.
- Common mistakes to avoid in writing statement of the problem in research — [Updated on 2023-10-25 03:43:55](https://hyp.is/vNDGsnLXEe68mq-ppcOESw/typeset.io/resources/statement-of-the-problem-in-research/) — Group: #bakalarka
    - Annotation: * Being too broad or too narrow
* Ignoring conflicting data
* Not specifying the sample size or demographic
* Over-reliance on outdated data
* Circular reasoning and lack of relevance
* Not emphasizing the "Why" of the problem
* Using unnecessary jargon or technical language
