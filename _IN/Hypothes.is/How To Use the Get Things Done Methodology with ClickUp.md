Collect What Has Your Attention
The idea here is to never let any ideas pass you by before recording them somewhere. As Allen likes to say, “your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” To that end, you probably have pen and paper on your desk to jot ideas, a journal for deeper thoughts or maybe you record notes on your phone.
Each note will have its own title and date, and click to expand or add to it even more.

Process What It Means
If you’re anything like me, you don’t always go back and review your notes and action items. With GTD, that’s not a problem. It’s the very next step. Ask “is it actionable?” and decide what to do with it next. If it takes less than two minutes, then you can act. Otherwise, file it away for reference or delegate it.

Depending on your thought or action item, you can immediately act on items within ClickUp. This may mean adding your insights as a comment or assigning a comment to delegate the action and next steps.

If it’s on a task that you need to be reminded of, you can minimize the task to the bottom of your screen in the task tray. Your task stays there until you have the time to act.
- Step 3: Organize — [Updated on 2023-04-09 07:37:38](https://hyp.is/TRVvNNaYEe2GpeeGgYgt9A/clickup.com/blog/gtd-system/) — Group: #bakalarka

Put It Where It Belongs
Here, Allen suggests creating lists with action reminders for your next tasks and categorizing all of those. If you’ve set up ClickUp spaces, projects and lists then this is a piece of cake.

For this step, it’s important to break up your big projects into actionable tasks that you can actually finish. Big projects can be overwhelming, which is where you can dive in to finish smaller tasks that add up to something bigger. With this project, you can then create more specific lists under there, such as for a particular company. In this list is where you would add individual tasks, such as “Follow up with Jeni on Q3 order.” 

- Step 4: Reflect — [Updated on 2023-04-09 07:38:24](https://hyp.is/ZTPOgNaYEe2OjOd6ey1gug/clickup.com/blog/gtd-system/) — Group: #bakalarka

Review Frequently
This is an important step in creating any list–what’s the progress and status of this? It’s good to clean up your list and to follow up to make sure the items you listed as important are still important and need attention. It won’t do any good to have to-do lists and project tasks stuffed with things you no longer deem important and then skip over them.
In ClickUp, it’s easy to solve this by using statuses and priority flags. You can use simple statuses, which are just that: done or not done.

Or if you have a task with more steps where you need more statuses, such as “Review” or “In Progress”, then ClickUp can help with that too. You can customize statuses depending on the project. It’s a great way to customize projects in the exact way you need them.

Then, if a task is high-priority or needs to be done quickly, you can flag each of your tasks to help you and/or your team understand its importance.
- Step 5: Engage — [Updated on 2023-04-09 07:38:46](https://hyp.is/wdsTKNaYEe2rLPOXnvcgAg/clickup.com/blog/gtd-system/) — Group: #bakalarka

Simply Do
This is the best step of all (or possibly the worst for you procrastinators out there). This is where you check your list and then do the things on it. The great thing about the Getting Things Done methodology is it allows you to focus and re-prioritize as needed.

For your tasks in ClickUp, you can change the dates and even add start dates as necessary as a reminder for when to start a task.

And remember when we talked about priorities up above? You can also filter your assigned tasks by priorities as well, which gives you a clear indication of where to start or review, no matter the status.

Anything else? Oh yeah, back to task tray. If you start a task but need to return to it later, just minimize it and it’s there for you to do and work on. Convenient, right?
